A lightweight, client-side tool for converting multiple images to a single PDF file. This project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, utilizing the `jsPDF` library for PDF generation.

## Features

- **Multi-Image Upload**: Users can select multiple images to include in a single PDF.
- **Centering and Alignment**: Each image is centered on its page, preserving the original aspect ratio without stretching or enlarging.
- **Client-Side PDF Generation**: The entire process happens client-side, ensuring quick conversion and no need for server uploads.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A clean and responsive UI makes it easy to use on various devices.
